# Trust It
is a system that provides a secure payment system or service request through trusted individuals to activate a smart contract between the parties. The smart contract begins 
automatic execution until the specified time, with both parties receiving funds and services.
This is done by agreeing to the contract terms. The service requester pays a portion of the amount, and notifications are sent to the service provider to start the work.
